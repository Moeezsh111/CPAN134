                <h2>Messi & Ronaldo - But who is the best?</h2>
                <p>Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are two of the best footballers of all time, arguably the very best of them all. And remarkably, their careers have largely coincided, with both players dominating the game for well over a decade now. But who is the best? <br> We compare them both in a number of different categories and let you decide the overall winner.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="div2">
                <h2>Who scores more goals?</h2>
                <p>Over their entire careers, it's Messi who edges the ratio, <label class="leo">with 0.79 goals </label> per game, whereas Ronaldo has scored <label class="cris">0.72 goals </label> per game. If we drill down into goals per minutes, Messi scores a goal<label class="leo"> every 104 minutes</label>, and Ronaldo scores a goal<label class="cris"> every 113 mins</label>. Ronaldo still has more all time career goals than Messi though Ronaldo has (<label class="cris"> 832 career goals</label> and Messi has <label class="leo">803 career goals</label>), but Ronaldo has played 139 more games over his career than Messi has.
                   Although Messi shades the overall ratio, Ronaldo spent more of his formative years as a more traditional right winger, only really starting to focus on goalscoring as his primary function in 2006, 3-4 years into his career. For Messi, it was 2-3 years until he completed the transformation from a nippy winger into a player hungry for goals above everything else. If we take these differing beginnings into account, the ratios would be even closer.
                   Of all the categories, goalscoring is the hardest to separate them on. This one's a tie.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="div3">
                <h2>Who provides more assists?</h2>
                <p>When it comes to assists, there's only one winner. Lionel Messi's playmaking abilities are right up there with the very best, and he has the numbers to prove it.<br>
                    Messi has racked up an impressive <label class="leo">354 assists</label> in 1018 career appearances, compared to Ronaldo's<label class="cris"> 236 assists</label> in 1157 games.
                    However, because Messi has a clear ascendancy when it comes to assists, this often leads people to fall into the trap of underestimating Ronaldo's proficiency in this area. Ronaldo's assist numbers are still extremely impressive compared to the other mere mortals that play the beautiful game.                   
                    In fact, Ronaldo has more in the Champions League, with <label class="cris">41 assists</label> to Messi's <label class="leo">40 assists</label> - granted Ronaldo has played 20 more matches than Messi, but this is still an impressive tally.                   
                    With that said, you can't ignore Messi's overall assist stats - he takes this category comfortably.

            <div id="div4">
                <h2>Who dribbles better ?</h2>
                <p> Ronaldo started his career as a tricky winger, when his game was all about running at and beating defenders with his pace and skill. As he has transitioned to an inside-forward / striker role over the years, 
                    dribbling has naturally become significantly less of a factor in Ronaldo's performances.
                    Messi also started his footballing career stuck to the by-line, eventually moving to a more central role as his primary position for most of his career. 
                    However, Messi plays a very different game to a traditional centre-forward, with his natural Number 10 abilities making him the perfect False 9. As a result Messi comes much deeper, towards the play, 
                    rather than making runs and playing off the shoulder of the defenders.                   
                    Because he often comes deep to receive the ball, dribbling is still a major part of Messi's game, completing an incredible <label class="leo"> 3055 dribbles</label> in the league and Champions League,
                     compared to Ronaldo's <label class="cris">1661 successful dribbles</label> (since 2003/04).                   
                    There is therefore little doubt that Lionel Messi is the best when it comes to dribbling.

                <h2>Who has won more individual awards?</h2>
                <p>Their stranglehold on the coveted <label class="trophy">Ballon d'Or</label>  award has been relentless, with Messi's<label class="leo"> 7 Ballon d'Or </label>trophies edging Ronaldo's haul of <label class="cris">5 Ballons d'Or</label> . No other player in history has won more than 3!
                    If Messi or Ronaldo didn't have each other to compete with for the award over the years, it's not inconceivable that one of them could have picked up the award 10 times or more.
                    In terms of UEFA's top award, it's Ronaldo that has the edge with <label class="cris"> 4 awards</label>(1x UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, 2x UEFA Best Player in Europe, 1x UEFA Men's Player of the Year) to Messi's 3 awards (1x UEFA Club Footballer of the Year, 2x UEFA Best Player in Europe).                   
                    In terms of golden boots, Messi has finished as the <label class="leo">league's top scorer 8 times</label>, winning the <label class="leo">European Golden Shoe on 6</label> of those occasions. Ronaldo has finished as top scorer in the league 5 times (once in the Premier League, once in Serie A, and 3 times in La Liga), 
                    winning 4 European Golden Shoes in the process.
                    Messi has however won the Golden Ball, awarded to the player of the tournament at the World Cup, on two occasions so this tie is his to take home.<br>

            <div id="div6">
                <h2>Who has won more trophies?</h2>
                <p>In terms of trophies, Messi has the overall lead, with <label class="leo">42 trophies</label> to Ronaldo's <label class="cris">34 trophies</label> (including Messi's 2008 Olympic triumph and 2005 U-20 World Cup).
                    Internationally, Messi has now won both the Copa America and the <label class="trophy">World Cup</label> with Argentina, while Ronaldo has won the Euros with Portugal as well as a Nations League trophy.                    
                    Messi has 11 league titles to Ronaldo's 7, but Ronaldo has the ascendancy in terms of <label class="trophy">Champions League</label> triumphs with <label class="cris">5</label> to Messi's <label class="leo">4</label>. 
                    There's not a lot in it, but the overall figures means Messi currently edges this one.
